Regression tests confirm all aspects work correctly.","pass",9,0.95,"na","src/main/nostling/relay-pool.ts:109-110;src/main/nostling/relay-pool.ts:256-260;src/main/nostling/relay-pool.ts:459;src/main/nostling/relay-pool.ts:469;src/main/nostling/relay-pool.ts:484-515;src/main/nostling/relay-pool.ts:524-532;src/main/nostling/service.ts:1191-1200;src/main/nostling/bug-relay-no-auto-reconnect.test.ts"
