# Verification Questions - Avatar Image Selector Feature

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION QUESTIONS

1. [Category: Code Quality] **Is there any dead code (unused functions, classes, or imports)?**

2. [Category: Code Quality] **Are there any parallel implementations (duplicate/redundant implementations of same functionality)?**

3. [Category: Code Quality] **Are all obsolete files (backups, old versions, temp files, commented-out code files) cleaned up?**

## MANDATORY COUNTERFACTUAL QUESTIONS

4. [Category: Counterfactual] **What information, if available earlier, would have prevented the most severe issue found?**

5. [Category: Counterfactual] **Which retrieval (doc, test, contract, prior run) would have most reduced uncertainty?**

## CREATIVE IMPLICATION-BASED QUESTIONS

6. [Category: Security] **Could the URL construction pattern (base URL + relative path) create XSS or SSRF vulnerabilities if the API response contains malicious URLs or redirects?**

7. [Category: Architecture] **Does the modal state management properly handle rapid open/close/reopen sequences without creating memory leaks or stale data displays from previous searches?**

8. [Category: Integration] **Could race conditions occur between the vocabulary fetch and the initial avatar search, causing the subject filter to display incomplete options or fail to apply the default "all subjects" filter?**

9. [Category: Error Handling] **Do API error states (network failures, 400/500 responses) properly reset the modal to a clean state, or could they leave the pagination controls, filter selection, or grid display in inconsistent states?**

10. [Category: Performance] **Could the image caching strategy combined with pagination cause progressive memory accumulation when users browse multiple pages across multiple modal sessions, eventually exceeding the 100MB LRU cache limit and triggering aggressive eviction?**

11. [Category: Testing Coverage] **Do integration tests validate the complete user workflow end-to-end (open modal → select filter → paginate → select avatar → verify URL populated → verify modal closes), not just individual component behaviors?**

12. [Category: Specification Alignment] **Does the implementation correctly handle all API response edge cases specified in the API documentation (empty results, offset beyond results, invalid filter values, rate limiting)?**
