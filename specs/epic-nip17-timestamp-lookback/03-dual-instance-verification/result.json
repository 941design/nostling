Implementation consists of: (1) All story 01 tests pass (13/13), (2) All story 02 tests pass (12/12), (3) No regressions in baseline tests. Manual dual-instance verification per CLAUDE.md protocol should be performed by user using Playwright MCP to confirm end-to-end message delivery with randomized timestamps."
